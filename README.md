# Accessing Non-Existent DOM Element Property
This repository demonstrates a common yet easily overlooked error in HTML/JavaScript: attempting to access a property of a DOM element that does not exist.  While not always resulting in a crash, this often leads to unexpected behavior or silent failures, making debugging difficult.
The `bug.html` file contains the buggy code. The `bugSolution.html` file demonstrates the correct approach.  Always validate the existence of properties before accessing them to prevent such issues.
